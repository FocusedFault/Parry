# Parry

Adds Mercenary's parry skill from Risk of Rain Returns. Multiplayer compatible.

Works like Risk of Rain Returns, go into a parry stance, if released right before an attack lands, you get a "perfect" parry that deals more damage and grants i-frames. Damage is dealt in a 13m sphere (explosion) around Merc.
