# Parry

Adds Mercenary's parry skill from Risk of Rain Returns.

While in the parry stance, damage is delayed by 0.75 seconds and each instance of damage plays a guillotine effect, if the button is released within that timeframe, you turn immune for 1 second and get a "perfect" parry for 1000% damage that exposes enemies.
If you miss you still do 500% damage and stun enemies for 1s. Damage is in a 13m radius around Mercenary, think of it as a small explosion. Yes it works on ALL instances of damage, just like RoRR. Have fun.
